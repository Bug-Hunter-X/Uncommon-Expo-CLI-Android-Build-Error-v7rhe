The solution involves a combination of troubleshooting steps:

1. **Update Gradle:** Ensure you're using the latest version of Gradle.  Check the Expo documentation for recommended Gradle versions for your project.
2. **Clean the Build:** Use the Expo CLI command `expo prebuild` or the equivalent command for Android Studio (clean project). This can help clear out any cached or corrupted build files.
3. **Check Android SDK:** Verify you have all necessary components installed in your Android SDK, including the appropriate build-tools and platform tools.
4. **Check Dependencies:** Ensure there are no conflicting dependencies in your `package.json` file.  If there are issues, try fixing them or removing packages that are not essential. 
5. **Invalidate Caches:**  In Android Studio, go to `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart...`  This can help resolve issues caused by corrupted cached data. 
6. **Detailed Logs:**  Enable more detailed logging in Expo CLI or Android Studio to get a better insight into the cause of the error. 

If the issue persists, try searching for the specific error message in the Expo forums or online to find solutions tailored to the error.
